|\anchor req-generator-randomness-a \ref req-generator-randomness-a "a." When a board is generated randomly, the mine distribution is uniform. Each field is equally likely to become a mine.|
|\anchor req-generator-randomness-b \ref req-generator-randomness-b "b." Any board can be randomly generated. This means a seed-per-board random generation can't be used, because for larger boards there are vastly more possible boards than there are seeds.|
